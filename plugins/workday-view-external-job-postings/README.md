## Introduction

The **“View External Job Postings”** plugin enables candidates to easily discover and explore open job opportunities at the organization directly from **Workday** using the Moveworks AI Assistant. This eliminates the need to manually navigate through the careers site or Workday portal, making it simpler for candidates to stay informed about available roles and apply in real time.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

### Agent Design

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `View access` to Job Requisitions
- `View access` to Job Postings

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use **TENANT** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **TENANT** in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get External Job Postings**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<API_SERVER_DOMAIN>/api/recruiting/v3/<TENANT>/jobPostings?limit=100&offset=0' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `limit` – Number of job postings returned per page
- `offset` – Starting position for pagination
