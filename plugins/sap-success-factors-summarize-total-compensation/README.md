shows the experience we are going to build.

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**SAP SuccessFactors Connector Guide**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors?hist=home%2Cbrws) for detailed instructions. Once completed, refer to our plugin installation documentation to install the **Summarize Total Compensation** plugin in minutes.

For **Summarize Total Compensation**, ensure the following permissions are enabled in SAP SuccessFactors:

**Required Scopes:**

- `View Employee Salary Information`
- `View Employee Bonus Information`
- `User Profile View Access`

Note: Equity, stock, or RSU details are not available as standard SAP SuccessFactors entities and cannot be queried using the OData APIs. Please refer to the [**SAP SuccessFactors OData API documentation**](https://api.sap.com/) for more information.

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
