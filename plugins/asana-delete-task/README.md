# Introduction

The **Asana Delete a Task** plugin allows users to delete a specific task in a project directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. With this plugin, users can quickly navigate through workspaces, teams, and projects to view task details such as due dates, assignees, and statuses — and then remove tasks that are no longer needed, without leaving their workflow.

This guide will help you install and configure the plugin in **Agent Studio** within minutes.

# Prerequisites

- Access to Agent Studio
- [Asana Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=asana) built in Creator Studio (follow the Asana Authentication guide to create your connector)

# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our **Asana Connector Guide** to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Asana Delete a Task** plugin in minutes.

For **Asana – Delete a Task**, you will also need to add the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `workspaces:read` – Allows reading available workspaces
- `teams:read` – Allows reading teams in a workspace
- `projects:read` – Allows reading project details
- `tasks:read` – Allows reading task details from a project
- `tasks:write` – Allows modifying or deleting tasks
- `tasks:delete` - Allows deletion of tasks within a project
- **Assign Necessary Permissions** – Ensure that the admin account used to generate the Personal Access Token for your Asana connector is explicitly added to all Asana Workspaces where the plugin will operate.

> Note: Users can only delete tasks for projects that belong to teams they are part of.
> 

After configuring the connector, refer to our installation documentation for more details on completing the setup.
