# **Introduction**

The **Look Up Employee Information** plugin allows HR team members to instantly access employee details from **SAP SuccessFactors** directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. Users can search by a partially matching name, email, employee ID, or department to quickly retrieve key information such as role, department, division, manager, location, hire date, and employment status. This eliminates the need to log into the SAP portal, giving HR teams fast, accurate, and convenient access to employee records whenever they need them.

This guide will help you install this plugin within minutes in Agent Studio. Let’s get started!

the experience we are going to build.

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**SAP SuccessFactors Connector Guide**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=sap-success-factors&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- **`View`** access to the **User** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

# **Appendix**

# **API #1: Fetch an Employee’s User Information**

The **Fetch User Information** API retrieves a User’s details based on a given User Attribute Filter (in this case, User Display Name). With this API, you can add filters, display selected fields, and expand on line items within specific fields using query params. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --location 'https://<API_SERVER>/odata/v2/User?$filter=tolower(displayName)%20like%20%27{{employee_name}}%25%27&$select=userId,username,displayName,email,gender,dateOfBirth,hireDate,country,location,division,department,title,jobLevel,payGrade,status,manager/userId,manager/displayName,manager/email&$expand=manager' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters :**

- $filter (string) ****– Filter items by property values
    - You can filter by email, displayName, manager/displayName, department and other User level properties (filterable: true).
        - You can also do a substring match using the `LIKE` operator in query params.
            - For ex: `displayName like 'Ana%'` returns all users whose display name starts with "Ana"
- $select (array[string]) – Select properties to be returned
    - For users, you can display properties like userId, username, firstName, lastName, displayName, email, gender, dateOfBirth, hireDate, etc.
- $expand (string) ****– Additional field to be included to view details like manager/displayName, etc (personal/other info).
- **`optional_fields`**(string) – Specify additional fields to include in the response, such as $top,$skip
- **Important Note**
    - The `$expand` query parameter lets you look up related field, while the `$select` query parameter is used to display specific fields for the expanded fields. To show additional details from an expanded entity, use the format: `<entity_name>/<nested_field_to_be_displayed>`.
