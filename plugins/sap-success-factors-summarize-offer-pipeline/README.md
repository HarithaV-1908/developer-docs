This ensures that the recruiters can quickly access accurate offer data, make informed decisions, and maintain a clear overview of the hiring pipeline.

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up SAP SuccessFactors before installing this plugin. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

You will also need to add the following permission:

- `View` access to the **JobApplication** and **JobRequisition.**

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get All Job Titles and Job Requisition Ids**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobRequisition?$expand=recruiter,jobReqLocale&$filter=recruiter/email eq '{{email}}'&$select=jobReqId,jobReqLocale/jobTitle&$top=30' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

```

**Query Parameters :**

- $filter (string) – Filter items by property values
    - You can filter by recruiter email or a keyword in the job title. This filtering works dynamically across different properties.
        - You can also do a substring match in query params.
            - For example: `substringof('Production', jobReqLocale/jobTitle)` returns all job titles containing “Production”.
- $select (array[string]) – Select properties to be returned
    - For users, you can display properties like jobReqId etc.
- $expand (string) – Additional field to be included to view details like recruiter.
- **`optional_fields`**(string) – Specify additional fields to include in the response, such as $top.
- **Important Note**
    - The **`$expand`** query parameter lets you look up related field, while the **`$select`** query parameter is used to display specific fields for the expanded fields. To show additional details from an expanded entity, use the format: **`/`**.

### **API #2: Get Job Applications by Requisition ID**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobApplication?$filter=jobReqId eq {{req_id}} &$select=applicationId,jobReqId,status,firstName,lastName' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_INSTANCE>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Query Parameter:**

`req_id` :  (string) - The Job Requisition ID used to fetch all job applications for that requisition.
