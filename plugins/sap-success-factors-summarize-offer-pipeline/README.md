The **Summarize Offer Pipeline** plugin streamlines the tracking and management of job offers throughout the recruitment process. Users can view all offers associated with their accessible job requisitions, see details such as candidate information, status, and job title, and monitor the progress of each offer. This ensures that the recruiters can quickly access accurate offer data, make informed decisions, and maintain a clear overview of the hiring pipeline.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up SAP SuccessFactors before installing this plugin. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

You will also need to add the following permission:

- `View` access to the **JobApplication** and **JobRequisition.**

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get All Job Title and Job Requisition Id**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobRequisition?$expand=recruiter,jobReqLocale&$filter=recruiter/email eq '{{email}}'&$select=jobReqId,jobReqLocale/jobTitle&$top=30' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

```

**Query Parameters :**

- $filter (string) – Filter items by property values
    - You can filter by recruiter email or a keyword in the job title. This filtering works dynamically across different properties.
        - You can also do a substring match in query params.
            - For example: `substringof('Production', jobReqLocale/jobTitle)` returns all job titles containing “Production”.
- $select (array[string]) – Select properties to be returned
    - For users, you can display properties like jobReqId etc.
- $expand (string) – Additional field to be included to view details like recruiter.
- **`optional_fields`**(string) – Specify additional fields to include in the response, such as $top.
- **Important Note**
    - The **`$expand`** query parameter lets you look up related field, while the **`$select`** query parameter is used to display specific fields for the expanded fields. To show additional details from an expanded entity, use the format: **`/`**.

### **API #2: Get Job Applications by Requisition ID**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobApplication?$filter=jobReqId eq {{req_id}} &$select=applicationId,jobReqId,status,firstName,lastName' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_INSTANCE>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Query Parameter:**

`req_id` :  (string) - The Job Requisition ID used to fetch all job applications for that requisition.
