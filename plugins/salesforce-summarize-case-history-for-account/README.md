the experience we are going to build.

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Salesforce** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access**: `Read` access to the **Case** and **Account** objects.
- Ensure the user has permission to view all Case and Account records relevant to their team, territory, or assigned accounts.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Fetch All Cases for an Account**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/services/data/vXX.X/query/?q=SELECT+CaseNumber,+Subject,+Status,+Priority,+Type,+IsEscalated,+CreatedDate,+ClosedDate,+Account.Name,+Owner.Name,+Owner.Email+FROM+Case+WHERE+{{filter_query}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameters**

- `{{filter_query}}` – A **dynamic SOQL filter** that changes based on the user’s request.

**1. By Account Name and Date Range**

```bash
Account.Name LIKE '%{{account_name}}%' AND CreatedDate %3E%3D {{start_date}} AND CreatedDate %3C%3D {{end_date}}
```

**2. By Account Name, Owner, and Date Range**

```bash
Account.Name LIKE '%{{account_name}}%' AND Owner.Email='{{owner_email}}' AND CreatedDate %3E%3D {{start_date}} AND CreatedDate %3C%3D {{end_date}}
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `{{account_name}}` – Name of the account to filter cases.
- `{{owner_email}}` – Email of the case owner.
- `{{start_date}}` – Start date for filtering cases.
- `{{end_date}}` – End date for filtering cases.

**Note:** This allows a **single API** to handle both account-level and owner-level case queries dynamically.
