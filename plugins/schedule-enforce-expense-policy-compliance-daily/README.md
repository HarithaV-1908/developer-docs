description: On a daily schedule, the agent pulls newly submitted expense reports
  from SAP Concur, fetches the latest policy from SharePoint, and evaluates each line
  with LLM reasoning (category, amount, merchant, attendees). It flags high-risk items
  and compiles a succinct summary with suggested fixes for AP review, keeping the
  queue prioritized and close-ready.
