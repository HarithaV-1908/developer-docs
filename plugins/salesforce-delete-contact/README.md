## Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for **Salesforce** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce?hist=home%2Cplgn.salesforce-create-campaign-inside-account%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

Ensure the following permissions are granted:

- **`Delete` access** on the **Contact** object – required to remove contacts from Salesforce.
- **`Read` access** on the **Account** object – ensures associated account information can be verified before deleting a contact.
- **`API Enabled` permission** – required to execute REST API calls for deleting contact records.

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
