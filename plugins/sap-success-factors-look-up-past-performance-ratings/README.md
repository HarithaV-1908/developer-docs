## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the **Look Up Past Performance Ratings** plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user have the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `View` access to the **User** entity
- `View` access to the **FormFolder** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
