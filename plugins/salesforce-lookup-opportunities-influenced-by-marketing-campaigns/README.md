## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Salesforce** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Note:** To enable the Campaign List functionality, ensure that the Salesforce integration user has the required object and field-level permissions.

Specifically, verify that the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access:** Read access to the **Campaign** and **Opportunity** objects.
- **Field Access:** Read access to fields such as **Id, Name, CreatedDate, Status, Type** (for Campaigns) and **Id, Name, Amount, StageName, CreatedDate, CloseDate** (for Opportunities).

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
