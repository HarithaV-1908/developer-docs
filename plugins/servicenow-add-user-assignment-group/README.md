## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions and roles:

**Table Access**:

- `Read` access to the `sys_user` and `sys_user_group` tables.
- `Read` and `Create` access to the `sys_user_grmember` table.

**Roles Required**:
- `user_admin`
- `security_admin`

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
