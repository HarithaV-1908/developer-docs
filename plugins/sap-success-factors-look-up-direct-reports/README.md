## **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) Guide for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the **Lookup Direct Reports** plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `View` access to the **User** entity
- `View` access to the **DirectReports** entity (expanded from User)

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

## **Appendix**
